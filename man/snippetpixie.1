.SH NOTES
.P
Abbreviations should be short, easy to remember and hard to trigger accidentally.
.P
It helps if an abbreviation includes either a key word from the fully expanded text, or an initialization or acronym that is part of it.
.P
For example, if you regularly wrote "Snippet Pixie" ðŸ˜‰ you might use "\fBsp\fR".
.P
However, there are a lot of words that include the letter combination "\fBsp\fR", (see https://www.wordfind.com/contains/sp/), so there's a reasonably high chance that Snippet Pixie would expand that abbreviation when you didn't want it to.
.P
So instead it's common to add a "\fBtrigger character\fR" to the end of the abbreviation. This is commonly a character that isn't found in normal sentences such as "\fB`\fR" or "\fB~\fR" that is easy to find on your keyboard. Often just appending a space is enough, or doubling up characters.
.P
I personally use "\fB`\fR" (commonly known as grav or backtick) a lot as it's a single keystroke on my British layout keyboard just below my Escape key. So for me "\fBsp`\fR" is a natural abbreviation for "\fBSnippet Pixie\fR".
.P
However, I could see using "\fBsp \fR" or "\fBspp\fR" for the abbreviation.
.P
If you do use a trailing space as your trigger character you might find it useful to include a trailing space in the text that is expanded, e.g. "\fBsp \fR" expands to "\fBSnippet Pixie \fR" as it's more natural when typing.
